# How to run
To run this locally, you have to run a localhost server, for example, using Python.

For Windows, make sure you have Python3 installed and run ```localhost_py.bat```

Or you can run ```python -m http.server <port>``` in the root directory

After the local server is started, you can connect to ```127.0.0.1:<port>``` using a Web Browser

OR, run our hosted version: http://billisagarbage.nctu.me/

Do NOTE that the hosted version will be the latest stable commit, if you want to try the newest things you'll have to run it yourself.
